SoulCraft
=========

The W.I.P. mod Soulcraft by Seremis

Soulcraft is about changing entities through their genes. 
The mod add a Soul to every entity and makes it possible to create all kinds of different entities. Imagine something like a cross-breed between a zombie and a pig, looking like a deformed zombie, hostile and not burning in daylight. This makes it possible to create anything you want, but the mod is still in development at the moment. 

ETA: Probably somewhere in August (2014)
